Utilizing the button element versus using the input type element makes it easier to personalize
buttons for websites.
 The input type buttons are very bland and boring, whereas using the button 
element allows for change via CSS. 
The only drawback to using the button type is when using in 
Internet Explorer as it then becomes buggy. Using
button element also helps to make your code more efficient and streamline, which saves the coder from doing 
tedious work. However, as the main focus is that your page is compatible with different browsers, I believe it 
would be better to stick with the input type than the button element, just to be safe.
